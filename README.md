### README.md (For each Practical):

Each practical should have a corresponding `README.md` inside its folder, detailing the problem statement, steps, and outputs.

Example for **Practical-01**:

```markdown
# Practical 01: 16 Qubit Random Number Generator

## Objective

The goal of this practical is to implement a 16 Qubit Random Number Generator using quantum computing principles.

## Problem Statement

Create a quantum circuit using Qiskit that implements a random number generator based on the superposition and entanglement of qubits.

## Steps

1. Initialize quantum and classical registers.
2. Create the circuit and apply the Hadamard gate to each qubit.
3. Measure the qubits to generate random numbers.

## Output

Once the program is run, the generated random number will be displayed as a sequence of binary values.

## Usage

To run the code, use the following command:

```bash
python code.py
```

## Example Output

```
Generated Random Number: 1010110010010101
```

## Dependencies
```
- Python
- Qiskit
